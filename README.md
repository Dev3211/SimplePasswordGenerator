# SimplePasswordGenerator

It's a simple PHP scipt which allows you to generate random passwords by either executing the script from the console or visiting it from the web. The maximum length is 30 in the script and can be increased by changing 30 to whatever number you want.

An example of the output:

=DQMD9,ZeAVDxAkWIUy27Tp7LClC,: 

Cool right? You don't have to worry about it generating same password over and over again because the script only generates random password based on the length.
